29	590	You may not know me.
810	5299	Alright, I'm Forsen, the dankest streamer on Twitch, of course.
8495	10155	Well, that's pretty much who I am.
10656	12997	All right, so you stream games for a living?
13297	13477	Yes.
14518	16519	So obviously this is the beginning.
17419	20581	Maybe before... So this is going to be a free conversation.
20641	23743	We will probably jump around from one topic to another.
24443	27745	So, Sebastian, I know that you were a Strayed 8 student.
28625	29606	So Strayed 8.
29966	30566	Pretty much.
30726	35169	I mean, I had two subjects that I had the second best grade in.
35765	36005	Yeah.
36626	41430	And was it because you were not good enough in those subjects or was it something else?
43661	46543	Maybe one of them, one of them was physical education.
46803	53326	I had some asthma growing up, so surprised that the computer nerd with asthma didn't make the best grade.
54747	57608	But the other one was chemistry.
58069	61510	And I think that that was unfair.
61811	65012	A lot of people say that, you know, they had a shitty teacher.
65032	65993	That's why they got their grade.
66053	71316	But, you know, I think my teacher was a substitute teacher that year, actually.
72256	86208	I'm very young, like 24 or something, I don't remember, but I think I corrected him once or twice in a lesson and that was like not the best idea to do, even if it's, you know, correct.
87549	89450	So it ended up being the second best grade.
89770	93474	I don't think he liked me very much, but it is what it is.
94034	101180	So, all right, apart from chemistry and PE, straight A's, what led you to actually go for the straight A's?
103478	105359	Well, I think it was a couple of things.
106340	120786	I played a shit ton of games growing up and I know that a lot of people have these nagging parents where you're not allowed to play games, they will shut off your internet and I've heard all of these stories from friends and whatnot.
123608	129592	My mother said that I could play as much games as I want as long as I have the best grades.
130533	135918	So that was like a deal between us, which worked out very well.
136818	139801	Very little drama revolving my computer gaming.
140281	146066	And also the fact that once I started going for these highest grades, I had, you know,
147446	150329	Friends that also was going for the highest grade.
150409	156415	So it became somewhat of a friendly competition, you know, where the punishment was banter.
157035	167885	If you fucked up a test or report or, you know, so it became, you know, a little bit of both, you know, the fact that you're allowed to play as much games as you want and competition wise.
168806	175219	Would you describe your childhood was then all just studying and gaming?
175499	179868	Yes, I would say exclusively gaming and studying.
182378	186901	But it helps that you're smart, so a bit more gaming than studying.
188321	193144	And in terms of games and gaming, were you also on the top?
193164	194065	Were you also the best?
196126	199348	Yeah, I've always had an easy time with games.
199968	201869	I started playing at a very young age, right?
202309	205731	You had friends who also played games, so it became a lot of gaming.
207673	211218	I figured out that I was pretty good at games and still am.
211739	218088	When you say pretty good at games, what did you feel that you did differently than others that you had?
221308	238600	Well, I think that what it comes down to in games is there are, of course, different genres, but if you want to be good at several genres of games, you have to have a pretty good pattern recognition, logical thinking.
239280	240681	Those are the foundations, I think.
241542	248386	You have to be able to pick up on what works and what doesn't work very fast whenever you're learning a new game genre.
251408	261299	You can be very good at one specific game if you have good reactions or if you're fast with your fingers, you can be good at RTS.
263020	270689	So it depends, but if you want to be good at several games, it has to be logical thinking, I think, which is the most important one.
271189	275514	Alright, so do you remember any unhappy times?
276394	280378	For example here in Stockholm or then later when you moved to Spain?
280899	281640	Unhappy times?
283213	293975	Well, I didn't grow up with... Both of my parents were into real estate.
295035	296676	They worked with real estate quite heavily.
297176	306117	And back in the early 90s, there was a real estate crash where everyone basically lost everything if you were leveraged.
306177	309198	And most people were because the banks were lending out a lot of money.
310622	312490	Four real estate projects and stuff back then.
312670	314880	So growing up,
317522	319183	I didn't have the most money.
321364	323185	Obviously, everything is relative.
323626	329289	I still lived in Sweden, which was lucky, I guess, compared to other countries.
329990	334633	But overall, if you compare it to your surroundings, it wasn't that much.
334813	336294	Which you always do as a person.
336334	337114	Yes, of course.
339035	342478	Would you say that the experience of not having...
344679	345140	Yeah, absolutely.
345160	347422	I mean, I believe that growing up tough skin and being resilient is 10% nature, 9% nurture.
368602	383565	I think you're very heavily affected by your surroundings and obviously if you grow up with little money then your goal is going to be to make a lot of money later in life, right?
383765	388826	You don't want to feel this your entire life, right?
389487	391127	So it makes sense that
392671	394112	I personally had that as a goal.
395132	397474	I didn't have a specific job I wanted to do.
399175	402837	It kept going from whatever job I found out made the most money, you know.
403497	407139	So the goal was always to get rich.
407800	409421	So can you be more specific?
409501	412382	What kind of, you know, jokes were you actually thinking about?
412402	420107	I mean, first it was, you know, doctors were earning this and then corporate lawyers I found out.
420507	426090	At the age of 10, they were earning a lot of money defending these big companies.
426231	431414	It just went to whatever is the highest paying.
431854	440639	Later on in life, you realize that finance and those kind of things in general is the big givers.
444301	450402	I went to one of the best schools in Sweden, real estate and finance.
450542	467266	I studied before I started streaming because I realized that streaming was jumping 15 years ahead in the career ladder, you know, and then I could make my own choices even if I wanted to do what I was studying later on.
468294	477416	Going back to games, so obviously this is something that you were doing from the age of five until now, now you're 30, 31?
478076	480837	31, yes, unfortunately.
484558	485898	Do you still enjoy gaming?
486438	489439	Yes, I still love gaming, it's still my biggest hobby.
493840	496421	I think I did a pretty good job at
497662	502165	Keeping it a hobby instead of turning it into a full-fledged job.
504887	510030	I don't take the streaming part as serious as I take the gaming part.
511251	512251	I'm still enjoying games.
513152	516614	I will probably still game when I'm 60, I think.
518996	522258	And in terms of
525662	535835	Before you were thinking about becoming a doctor or a corporate lawyer, was there a time or around that time when you thought, all right, I can actually make money out of gaming?
538069	560026	Yeah, I mean, the goal was always to get into a very good school and then finish university and get a good job at some place, climb the career ladder and be wealthy by the time I'm, you know, 40 plus or something, which is usually how it goes.
560766	562748	Or real wealthy then, if you're lucky.
565190	569034	But then I still always play games through my entire life, right?
572932	585420	There was a point where I was playing StarCraft and I saw all these prize pools and I'm thinking to myself, hey, maybe it's fucking 2011 or 10 or whatever.
585800	592685	Maybe you can earn a lot of money playing video games nowadays, which was stupid sounding back then, honestly.
594486	602455	All I have to do is win all these tournaments with these hundreds and thousands of dollars in prize pools and it will be easy.
602535	604777	I can do what I like and earn money.
605058	610183	But then the Koreans came and that's not possible.
610444	613107	No one can win that much unless you put in
614508	620891	16 hours a day and it's not reasonable in the long run.
621312	625494	So I quickly gave up on playing games professionally.
628216	636401	And then I did see a few years later, though, a chance of earning money as a content creator instead.
637162	642087	With StarCraft and just, you know, understanding that, hey, this is probably a dead end for me.
642628	644089	How quickly did you realize this?
645491	647373	Well, it did take some years.
647713	650596	Honestly, I don't remember if it was 2012 or 2013, but
653839	659784	Between two and three years, it was still fun to play and it was still fun to go on tournaments and stuff.
661685	664487	But it wasn't something that you can do in the long run.
664527	668210	You have to start thinking about your future at one point.
669250	672533	And, you know, I went back to school.
672753	675215	I was playing during school to university.
676375	679257	But this time with a serious outlook on school.
680598	696266	But then I saw, you know, an opportunity with streaming when I was almost done with school and I was like, damn, I could skip 15 years, you know, climbing the company ladder if I just take a shot at the streaming thing right now.
696346	697567	But it has to be now or never.
698547	704491	So I know I ditched the last course I had before my exam, you know, graduation.
705331	705892	Do you remember?
705932	706712	What was the last course?
707193	707953	It was statistics.
708574	721503	I love statistics and it's implemented into... It was one of the reasons why I became so good with Hearthstone, counting cards and the chances of getting the exact cards you need remaining in your deck.
722744	726907	I love it, but the university statistics is a little bit too over-exaggerated.
727747	731170	It's not really implemented the same way as the lesser stuff.
731330	732791	It's more the...
735233	740897	The calculators and the pre-programmed, you know, formulas and stuff using that.
741198	745181	So, yeah, I didn't finish that course, but it was the last course I had.
745901	752447	So you realized, first you realized that there is no future in StarCraft for you.
752687	756170	Then you realized that, hey, there is this chance, you know, jumping at...
756730	760812	This streaming or gaming or content creating bandwagon and actually making some money.
761152	762153	So you turn to this.
762253	778341	But then I actually read in one of the, I don't think it was an interview, but I think it was a transcript of one of your streams when you also really quickly realized that within streaming, if you are chasing viewership money,
779957	783600	This is also a very dangerous road to go on.
784200	786022	Can you speak a little bit about this?
786502	787903	Yeah, sure.
789084	793987	Well, I mean, as I said before, my goal was always to become rich.
795748	801092	And even in my first couple of years of streaming, I still had that mentality.
801492	803834	I was still chasing, you know,
804534	813480	The higher viewership, you know, the sponsors and all the events and all that.
814381	820065	But I quickly realized that, you know, like it's a never ending battle.
820245	827030	I vividly remember counting like, oh, my God, I am earning $5,000 a month playing video games for a living.
827492	830254	Oh my god, I'm earning $10,000 playing video games for a living.
830934	836058	And oh my god, I'm earning $15,000 a month playing video games for a living.
836598	846485	But I realized this is the never-ending battle of dopamine rushes that will eventually give you diminishing returns.
850049	853512	You know, you are already the 1%, top 1%, right?
853632	854993	Why do you have to be the top 0.1%?
856234	866443	Like it's better to be completely, you know, stress-free, completely, you know, relaxed and happy in your life.
866783	874490	It's better to enjoy being the 1% than being stressed at the top 0.1% or 0.01% or whatever it is you're chasing, right?
878373	886962	So as long as you are completely stress-free in your life, you don't even need that much money.
887643	898554	Because even the most ordinary life, when it's completely stress-free, you have no anxiety or anything, it becomes a pretty good life, even without all the materialistic things.
901831	916097	I think this is very, very rare that you can be so conscious about making this decision at the very early stage because I think many people realize this a little bit later in life when
917157	927831	There is either no damage that was already done to their private life, to their health, or there's basically no turning back.
927851	932437	So why do you think that you saw it before it actually happened?
933057	941539	Well, I realized that it was like any other addiction and the sooner you break an addiction, the easier it becomes to break it.
942659	961503	So if you realize that, you know, you are never going to stop chasing the next goal early on, it becomes that much easier to just stop right there, be happy with what you got and just like,
962575	963696	Do what makes you happy.
963896	965197	Play what makes you happy.
965497	966938	Don't cater to other people.
967578	972461	You're already earning a lot.
972922	974223	Just play what you want to play.
974983	976264	Be stress-free in your life.
976824	978746	Take days off when you want to take days off.
979906	982988	Don't do anything for anyone else.
984709	990713	People sometimes feel like they owe your audience something, but you really don't.
993702	998724	They made you who you are, but they didn't do it out of their own kind, free will.
999084	1000725	They were entertained by what you did.
1000765	1002646	It was a mutual thing.
1003527	1010990	So a lot of streamers feel like they owe their audience to be live every day and do long streams.
1012091	1012951	But in reality,
1014770	1028372	You had a mutual growth when it comes to the stream and you should just do what makes you happy because in the long run you're gonna burn yourself out chasing that stuff and it's a never-ending battle.
1029353	1048221	This is what I, you know, when I talk to you, this is, I think, a pattern, you know, we talked before that I see that is really repeating that you see something, you are super aware to actually take a step back and look at the situation, kind of analyze which direction, you know, you would probably be going.
1048561	1054023	I don't think actually many people have this ability or they realize it a little bit later.
1054663	1057326	Would you maybe have some advice?
1057446	1067276	Because it seems that you are super aware of when you're speaking about stress, you're speaking about anxiety, you're speaking about stress-free, which can translate to being happy.
1068657	1071059	So you seem to be super aware of what is happening.
1072360	1085082	What advice would you have for people, how to make the step back, how to actually realize that something is happening that may not be the best for them?
1088023	1089683	I think it's very hard.
1091904	1094904	A lot of people are stressed, a lot of people are depressed.
1095904	1097905	They have a hard time pinpointing why.
1102547	1117230	I think that it's hard for a lot of people to stop caring about stuff and become stress free because people are lonely, right?
1117790	1124532	And in order to fit in with other people, they need to care about
1125455	1126875	You know, what they care about.
1128016	1133857	And it's things, if you are in a group where people are chasing, you know, success.
1134737	1137118	You also need to chase success.
1138398	1141559	Otherwise, you know, you're going to be shunned out of the group, right?
1143679	1147760	If you're in a group with people who care about a certain type of politics, you also have to care about that.
1149541	1154984	There is a saying that you are the result of the five people that you most frequently interact with.
1155724	1167151	So if you are in an environment that really cares about this stuff, you automatically care about it yourself, even though if it's not your motivation and it goes against your biology, against your feelings.
1167191	1169853	So yeah, continue.
1170413	1182102	Yeah, I think it's very important to break out of anxiety and depression and stress and all that stuff.
1184724	1185945	Mostly because of these factors.
1190809	1192370	There's a light at the end of the tunnel too.
1192410	1197495	You're building resilience right now if you are stressed and depressed and whatever.
1198055	1200958	It might not be the healthiest for your body, but your body is building
1202185	1222724	How can you, what would be the advice for people who, because I think at the end of the day, if you feel anxious and you feel unhappy, stressed, that it may be a moment for you to step back and actually become aware of what is happening in your life.
1223104	1226908	And I think you hit a really important note by saying that
1229062	1237526	It comes from actually, not from how you feel, but from what is happening around you and what other people feel about you.
1238046	1243069	It's kind of this, you know, external thing that you might not have under control.
1243769	1245770	So I think this is a really, really important point.
1245990	1252873	And do you remember when you, was it a gradual process for you to realize that actually- To grow a thick skin, you mean?
1253334	1257616	To grow a thick skin, but actually, you know, the beginning, just to start realizing,
1258397	1259551	Fuck, it's actually about me.
1260726	1271692	Yeah, I think it's always, not always, sometimes you have this eureka moment, but it's very rare.
1272613	1288482	I think it's more often than not a gradual process where you get thicker skin, but it comes a lot from, you know, reflecting a lot and really thinking about stuff in order to...
1290064	1294484	To become resilient, you have to think about what actually matters.
1296311	1310775	People who are anxious and stressed, they think about worst case scenarios and these are like unlikely events, but your brain makes you think that it's the most likely cause to happen, right?
1311355	1314916	Or the worst case usually, because I usually go through that as well.
1315196	1318697	And the worst case is usually not something that you cannot reverse.
1319237	1320998	So you can always, you know, take it back.
1321038	1322618	So it's not like the worst, worst case.
1323240	1338488	Yeah, and I mean, there is always, whenever I felt, you know, stressed or whatever in the past, I always felt a little bit good about it though, because I know...
1339028	1344031	Or I knew rather that I was developing, you know, something good out of it.
1344091	1348695	You know, next time I will be more resilient or next time I won't make this mistake.
1348775	1352897	You know, you will always get something good out of every bad situation.
1354118	1357120	You will always get something bad out of every good situation, too.
1357240	1358541	But you don't have to think about that.
1360002	1364165	This is a really interesting point and I think a very valid point.
1364645	1367647	There's a research and I think it was done by
1369388	1372750	Mrs. McGonagall, Kate, something like that.
1372770	1375131	Mrs. McGonagall, is that Harry Potter professor?
1375151	1387977	Yeah, it seems like, but she's actually a very profound and prolific writer and she writes about stress and anxiety.
1389057	1392018	And she was writing about the stress for her whole life.
1392138	1399100	And then there was one research paper that showed that it's not really stress itself, but it's really how you think about stress.
1399641	1404062	Maybe you feel and you think about stress that is actually destroying your life, then it will.
1404502	1409844	But if you feel that it's something that is actually helping you develop into becoming something better, something stronger,
1410764	1411725	It will do that as well.
1411905	1419031	Of course, there's chronic stress and short term stress, but I think how you think about it really, really matters.
1420112	1420972	Yeah, for sure.
1421092	1421433	For sure.
1421753	1422614	It's all about the mindset.
1423427	1434012	Alright, so did you, going into specifics, what did you learn not to do to avoid stress or to feel better?
1434212	1442996	Was there any particular activities and particular things that you started to avoid or not doing that eventually made you feel better?
1446538	1450759	Well, the first thing that comes to mind is, of course,
1453943	1461506	Social media and just doing browsing, you know, the internet and stuff.
1461626	1474731	I think we as humans, I think technology has developed way faster, way, way, way faster than our, you know, biology as humans can keep up with.
1475392	1478093	And we're getting too much intake all the time, right?
1478113	1481214	You know, there's tons of research probably done on this.
1482054	1483395	But I truly believe that
1484916	1491723	We're getting too much impressions all the time from the internet.
1491983	1498489	These are advice that a lot of people know about, but maybe they don't do it yet.
1498970	1502193	But for example, don't bring your phone into bed, right?
1504495	1507980	Avoid anything that interrupts your sleep at best.
1509722	1510643	Don't keep your phone on.
1511164	1514989	The best thing is if you can just cut out social media altogether.
1515409	1522719	A lot of people feel pressured to do it because that's something to talk about amongst your circle of friends.
1522979	1524640	Even if it's just online friends, right?
1525680	1535945	You have to keep up with what's happening in your little gaming world or Bitcoin world or whatever circle you're into, right?
1536645	1542548	So they feel forced to do it, but it's really not good for you, is what I believe.
1543108	1543768	I feel like it's...
1545829	1549971	They end up bringing it to bed and they end up sleeping poorly because of it, right?
1550111	1552372	And sleep is so important.
1552392	1555133	Yeah, not only that.
1555213	1558774	And I think it's a lot about, you know, basically these technologies.
1558855	1564917	And this is just hitting the nail on the head with the technology versus our biology.
1564977	1565957	Our biology didn't...
1567318	1568919	And we're on our way to see Forsen.
1568939	1570441	Hello, I am Forsen, the best gamer in the world.
1595402	1606692	You're going to have a hard time and I think limiting it because it's tough to just cut yourself off completely but limiting is definitely one of the things to do.
1606712	1609434	Yeah, and not just social media.
1609474	1615960	People are working now, for example, with these flex work hours from home and they're always...
1617901	1625247	They always have their emails or business or working emails connected to their phones at all times of the day.
1626648	1632031	Job no longer becomes a routine, it becomes spread out, scattered all over the day.
1632592	1635194	I think it's very important to have routines.
1636494	1638276	I think that's how we're supposed to function.
1640237	1645546	Of course, you can change routines and biological clocks a little bit over time.
1645566	1649653	But, you know, in general, you should have set times of the day.
1650274	1653139	Your body really enjoys knowing what happens next.
1654821	1658444	Not eating randomly at random hours, it fucks up your whole thing.
1660366	1669775	But yeah, I think routine is very important and technology really ruins that when everything is available at all times and, you know.
1669975	1670876	Keeps you distracted.
1670936	1671196	Yes.
1672017	1673618	And unfocused, definitely.
1674519	1677162	All right, so you've...
1679312	1684295	I want to get back to speaking about routines because I think this is a big topic.
1684335	1696101	But could you tell me a story when you made a big mistake which eventually turned into a really, really valuable lesson for you?
1699043	1703085	I mean, I learned something from every mistake.
1703506	1704246	I can't say...
1707734	1722129	A big specific one, but I remember as a kid playing poker, or sorry, that poker boom had just started, right?
1723110	1727154	And I thought I was so good at games so I could become as good as this too, you know?
1727514	1728575	So I bought some poker...
1731049	1735696	I love literature and theory and I knew it by heart.
1736016	1741284	I could close the book and I could tell you exactly what you should do with every hand on every position of the board.
1742145	1746631	But once, and I played like perfectly with play money.
1750110	1758216	And then I inserted $100, you know, at the age of 12 or whatever, which is a lot back then to play with.
1758977	1762819	And I lost it all playing with real money.
1763600	1769564	And I had such anxiety over it and stress over it because, you know, I didn't know what happened.
1770285	1777590	I played so bad, even though I played everything perfectly on the play money and theory and I...
1778390	1787976	I realized that, you know, you can't become good at something without doing it in practice, you know.
1788396	1798322	You can do skydiving theory all you want, but you have to jump out of that plane, you know, to really learn skydiving, right?
1798642	1799443	And hopefully succeed.
1799623	1800904	Yeah, and hopefully succeed.
1801744	1802945	What's the best meal that you can do?
1804225	1805566	What's the best meal I can do?
1806946	1808787	I'm pretty good at the steaks.
1809247	1809647	Steaks?
1809707	1811328	Yeah, I always get them perfectly.
1811628	1817030	And is it just a simple meat and salt or do you have any special Forsen sauce?
1817470	1819491	I am not a sauce person.
1819931	1822011	I don't eat almost any sauce.
1823492	1829374	So I just like if you make the steak well, that's saucy enough.
1831653	1838515	All right, and do you have any special pans or any just a regular pan, piece of meat?
1838575	1840795	I don't know what they're called.
1841976	1843156	Okay, so tell me the recipe.
1844936	1852438	Okay, well, you take out the steak and you throw some butter and some oil in the pan.
1853338	1854979	High heat, of course.
1855879	1856739	Some salt and pepper.
1857499	1859300	I don't really eat salt that much anymore.
1859320	1859940	On the steak?
1861505	1862866	On the steak, yes, of course, yes.
1863326	1864247	When it's in the pan.
1864467	1865147	When it's in the pan.
1865668	1866288	Okay, in the pan.
1868890	1879217	And you just, depending on how you like it done, but I like my medium rare, so it's... Yeah, so it's very high heat, flip it once each side, right?
1879997	1888603	You slice up some potatoes, long slices, circular, put it in the oven, do some olive oil.
1889384	1891245	I used to salt, but I don't salt really anymore.
1891925	1900191	And then when you're done, you put in some extra butter in the pan with the meat and some cream and make a little bit of sauce out of that.
1902153	1908678	My trick is then use a little bit of garlic, but just smash the garlic, don't cut it because you can burn it very, very, very easily.
1908798	1914462	But even then put it and just put the buttery, garlicky stuff on the steak, then it's delicious.
1914662	1917524	Yeah, it's good stuff.
1917584	1917864	I don't...
1920929	1928174	It's sad to cut out salt but it's actually really good because you need so little salt once you get used to it for it to be the same.
1930236	1937801	But here I think we would disagree a little bit because I am a big believer in salt.
1938441	1941524	So salt is actually, if you don't have of course there is health issues.
1942344	1952692	If you have metabolic syndrome, if you are not living a very healthy life, then salt can be detrimental in terms of higher blood pressure and stuff like this.
1953773	1956735	But actually you need salt and you need a lot of it.
1956775	1958456	So I am a fan of salt.
1958716	1965921	Well, I'm not a scientist myself, so I cannot say, I can just say what, you know, a lot of scientists have said in the past.
1966081	1972806	But, you know, these things change all the time, you know, everything that gives you cancer and now it doesn't give you cancer, you know.
1973386	1980331	It's hard to follow, but I feel like there's a lot of salt added into products anyway.
1981372	1986915	Added salt is, I don't think, the most necessary thing, but I don't think it kills you.
1987936	2004723	Do you feel, you know, if you look at the obvious risks of streaming and I, you know, I always say this to all of our streamers that you are really fighting against your biology because usually you are streaming at night.
2005984	2014007	Usually there's like big lights shining at you which messes up your, as you said, circadian rhythms and biology and all sorts of stuff.
2014267	2015408	There's also the
2015748	2016689	And I'm here to talk about Dopamine Rush.
2016869	2022093	And Dopamine Rush is that you mentioned with, you know, viewers looking at the viewer count, donations, subscriptions.
2022674	2026157	So it's a tough job, you know, mentally and actually to keep sane.
2027918	2029980	And I think many people get gobbled up.
2032000	2051467	Any advice for people to actually, this is not a good question, but do you see a mistake or a pattern that is happening again and again with people that are streaming and then they later on pay the price?
2053608	2054288	Yes, of course.
2054608	2068697	I mean, it's not really that much of a mistake, but whatever you do at the start of your streaming career sets the tone for the remainder.
2068777	2077562	It's very hard for streamers to break free from something if it takes too long for them to realize.
2078443	2081505	So a lot of streamers can be stuck with one game
2083170	2085359	Forever, because, you know, they jumped ship
2087133	2091454	You know, too late and it didn't work out and, you know, they go back and forth.
2091714	2100417	And a lot of streamers, I think they need to set the atmosphere early on.
2100497	2104058	I know it's hard because when you're a new streamer, what's working is working.
2104098	2105599	If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
2106159	2111121	But, you know, there will be a point in time where you might want to do something else.
2111401	2113802	And if you haven't already set the...
2116202	2118603	I have a question for you guys.
2118663	2119803	I have a question for you guys.
2119823	2121463	I have a question for you guys.
2146589	2150192	So there are things like that, of course, for new streamers.
2154216	2165748	There are other life hacks, of course, where if you know you're going to have a bad day streaming, there's some other big streamer, you know,
2168695	2175297	Streaming in your place and is doing some big event or something, you know, one of your competitors.
2176057	2180519	People often say, oh, be consistent, stream every day, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2180859	2186501	But sometimes it's better not to stream those days if you are thinking about your viewership and all that stuff.
2186541	2193383	Because I think it was Soda Poppin who said, you're only as good as your last two streams, which I actually agree with quite a lot.
2194423	2199005	You're only as good as your last two streams because those are the streams that the people remember.
2199165	2204307	So if you have like really bad streams, it can really affect your whole channel like negatively.
2204727	2210590	But this is only if you're in it for the grind game and for the climbing the viewer ladder and stuff like that.
2211110	2218053	I see people make this mistake thinking that consistency is the most important thing when in fact, playing it smart is the most important thing.
2218595	2219476	All right, all right.
2220016	2235531	You know, understanding where you come from and how you, you know, throughout the years, where of, you know, your mental situation developing, how you developed some resilience, mental toughness.
2238614	2241377	The question that comes to mind is what was first?
2243032	2245153	Forsen or the Forsen Vice?
2246294	2251478	Was that the, you know, did the community find you and because they are so engaging
2254296	2255917	Yeah, I understand the question.
2256017	2259138	It was the chicken or the egg.
2259378	2273781	I mean, obviously the community started to form like this because of my lack of care, so to speak, about a lot of things.
2275101	2283906	I did not care about moderation or political topics or anything like that.
2284166	2288469	And then obviously then the community forms based on that.
2289209	2297093	And then, you know, my resilience forms because of that community towards that type of community.
2297214	2299475	So I think it was a process of...
2303856	2307317	So the community shaped you, but you also kind of shaped the group.
2307377	2309398	Yes, I was the egg.
2309838	2310438	I was first.
2312399	2314880	But then the hen laid the next egg, right?
2315360	2316600	Okay.
2317380	2324663	And do you see any development with the community or did you have any clashes throughout the year that come to mind?
2325323	2328724	I clash with them all the time because I think it's fun.
2330347	2336033	I think it's fun to piss them off and they think it's fun to piss me off.
2338015	2339516	Any examples that come to mind?
2340377	2345762	Nah, it's just a constant banter, really.
2349606	2353170	No, no specifics, just a constant banter.
2354657	2359159	I like playing what I feel like playing.
2359399	2364520	Some people don't like that and there's an issue at hand.
2364620	2370582	Unfortunately for them, I have the final say, so I always win.
2372443	2373443	But it's fun for them to try.
2374711	2380357	The first question is what game character do you most identify with and why?
2382940	2388527	I think Kratos from God of War because he's pretty badass.
2390885	2391865	He has a nice beard too.
2392045	2394286	Yeah, I see the similarity.
2394306	2396627	Yeah, I do.
2397047	2398088	I will probably at one point.
2398108	2398548	All right.
2398848	2404350	So what's your absolute favorite thing, word or phrase to say right now?
2405931	2406331	Surely.
2407591	2409492	All right.
2410052	2412793	And what do you spend a silly amount of money on?
2415254	2415354	Oh,
2419853	2420233	I don't.
2421154	2421454	Steak?
2422595	2423556	No, not anymore.
2424417	2425918	I don't eat that much meat anymore.
2427739	2430942	No, I don't actually spend a silly amount of money on anything, actually.
2431002	2439008	I mean, games, I would say, but, you know, that's just business, you know, business expenses.
2440069	2443011	Alright, so why do your friends like you?
2444366	2445467	Why do my friends like me?
2445767	2446607	Because they have to.
2447068	2449409	We've known each other since kindergarten, pretty much.
2451930	2452771	It's not their choice.
2455212	2459355	If you could design a perfect game for yourself, what would it look like?
2460375	2468120	For myself, it would be some competitive game.
2472382	2473523	The genre, I don't know.
2477439	2478900	A very nice competitive game.
2479880	2480281	I don't know.
2482742	2487966	My head is like for the stream, for playing on stream, for playing off stream.
2487986	2489226	No, for yourself.
2491148	2491768	Only for myself.
2491888	2493149	Yeah, you're banned from Twitch.
2493289	2493749	Okay.
2494190	2496871	You just can enjoy your game in peace.
2497912	2498873	What game are you playing?
2499533	2501294	I would play something competitive.
2505307	2512089	Probably FPS, I think, if I had to pick a genre, but a card game could work too.
2514030	2516330	Okay, describe your life in one Twitch emote.
2518391	2519111	Seems good, man.
2521332	2528114	Alright, if you could reincarnate as anything, a thing, a person, an animal, what would it be?
2529704	2530905	Probably a dog, I think.
2532046	2536510	I think dogs with owners, good owners, live pretty good lives.
2536951	2542616	They're stress-free and they have short lives, but not to them, you know.
2543797	2545478	To them, it's just an ordinary life.
2546699	2549422	I think a dog would be my choice.
2549847	2553890	Alright, what do you think hell would look like for you?
2554950	2556391	What hell would look like for me?
2557272	2561194	On a serious note, maybe being in an actual asylum.
2562755	2572641	I think if you are not mentally insane, but everyone does believe it and you're forced to be in an asylum, I think that's a very scary situation.
2575803	2577224	Ironically enough, yeah.
2579031	2579351	Okay.
2580553	2585658	If you could time travel, what time would you like to go to but permanently?
2586780	2587480	You cannot go back.
2587540	2588281	Permanently.
2588461	2588822	All right.
2589102	2589422	So...
2591503	2607626	I would probably go back to maybe the 50s because that's far enough away from the internet that I wouldn't care that much once I got to that age.
2609027	2613267	Yeah, I think the 50s were a good time living through all the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
2613287	2614108	As a real estate investor.
2617292	2622517	As a whatever, I'm a plumber even, you know, like I think it's just better times back then.
2623177	2625139	Okay.
2625659	2628842	What is the most challenging thing about being yourself?
2629863	2633025	The most challenging thing about being myself?
2634746	2637749	Being so goddamn good at every game, you know.
2639070	2641452	There's no progress, I'm just the best instantly.
2642489	2645651	Alright, what do you consider your best investment so far?
2645731	2649693	It could be in yourself, money investment, buying a book, learning a new skill.
2650653	2652414	Best investment in myself?
2653174	2657736	I think my first microphone and webcam for streaming, I guess.
2658897	2659337	Good answer.
2660198	2663199	So what was your most valuable failure?
2664019	2665540	The one that you learned the most from?
2666541	2667241	And what did you learn?
2670883	2670983	Uh...
2673484	2679068	Well, I would say that one of them was the poker thingy.
2680769	2691077	Right, so except salt in the past two years, is there anything particular that you completely changed your mind about?
2692870	2708021	In the last two years, I don't think I changed my mind about anything in specific, but, you know, last five years or five to six years, I've changed my mind about, you know,
2710363	2715905	What the end goal of life is, you know, not about climbing the success ladder, as we talked about earlier.
2717005	2731592	And this is like a gradual thing that you come to realize with wisdom and age that you have to be happy about the situation, you know, instead of chasing potential
2732492	2736835	What is the worst advice commonly given out in your field that you think is completely useless?
2749507	2759435	Well, I see a lot of people being burnt out on a specific game or just streaming in general.
2759656	2766421	And then I see all these people replying that, you know, take off or play whatever you want.
2766641	2771145	We still, you know, we still watch whatever you want to do, you know.
2771745	2782274	They're giving advice as a hive mind when in reality they're all separate beings and it's just a shitty advice for streamers to listen to in general.
2782314	2793344	I think that they should do whatever they want but they have to truly believe it themselves and not believe that their audience will be there for them at any given time.
2796104	2800227	In recent times, is there anything you have become better at saying no to?
2800847	2801007	No.
2806512	2809314	What did you learn from games that you apply in real life?
2810373	2811433	Growing up, it was English.
2813234	2824276	Nowadays, I think that playing games keeps the logical thinking part of your brain active, which is applied in real life too, right?
2824336	2830458	So as long as you keep that part of your brain active, it's good for real life stuff too.
2831598	2834099	What is the one thing you would like to change about yourself?
2837359	2839100	Right now, nothing.
2841167	2846311	What do you do when you feel unfocused, distracted or overwhelmed?
2847131	2853836	I don't get stressed or overwhelmed that often or anxiety.
2854877	2868368	Yeah, I mean, I guess my stream knows this, but whenever I get like tech issues and stuff, I can't stand it when 500 different people are trying to give you
2869809	2875734	Different advice on how to fix something tech related and I have no clue what I'm doing.
2876355	2882020	And you know, it's taking away from the game on what to play, you know, like the fucking this hassle.
2882680	2884742	I just, nope, shut down.
2885182	2887645	I'll do this tomorrow with a new mindset.
2887725	2888946	I'm done with this right now.
2889987	2892871	I'll do this, you know, off stream or tomorrow.
2893332	2900441	So I kind of like just push it forward and prevent myself from, you know, becoming too stressed about anything.
2900842	2901703	And you like to change that?
2903234	2904255	I don't like to change that.
2905675	2906556	I think it's a good method.
2907836	2909417	You push it a little bit.
2909657	2912558	People push things too far into the future.
2912718	2925944	But just, you know, if you're overwhelmed by something, just leave it until after you fucking slept or after you ate or after you went for a walk or something, you know, don't do it in the moment.
2926705	2927625	But don't push it too far.
2928825	2932047	In what situations do you doubt yourself the most?
2933271	2935553	In what situations do I doubt myself the most?
2936153	2937274	Apart from the technical stuff.
2939476	2944620	When I'm not pretending and I'm actually bad at a game, then I'm doubting myself.
2945921	2950225	And in this case, what do you do when you need to boost your confidence?
2950245	2951846	I play a game I'm better at.
2952326	2956349	Alright, so maintaining control.
2956530	2956910	Perfect.
2957710	2960753	In what situations do you feel that you have the most control?
2963880	2964180	Always.
2965821	2967082	I always feel like I'm in control.
2968823	2971244	On a more serious note, right?
2972385	2976027	Whenever I play a game, I'm good at... I'm in control.
2976407	2977407	Alright, so playing games.
2977727	2978468	Yeah, playing games.
2980532	2988082	So if you were to give a TED talk on anything but your primary focus, which is streaming and games, what would it be?
2989304	2994831	I would have to look up a lot of terms and whatnot, but the general philosophy
2995752	3005776	I think I never read any philosophy, but everything I have ever thought of, there is a philosopher who thought of it before, right?
3006376	3007796	So they have terms for it.
3007837	3016220	But in general, I think philosophy is a fairly interesting topic.
3016560	3016860	All right.
3017400	3025423	So knowing what you know now, what advice would you give to a five years or ten years younger version of yourself?
3027634	3028594	Invest in Amazon?
3031095	3031676	Good answer.
3032616	3033236	Good answer.
3033356	3033717	All right.
3034337	3042620	So how would you spend your life if you had $100 million in your bank account right now?
3043821	3045681	Meaning you don't have to care about money.
3048222	3048843	The same way.
3049423	3052104	I barely spend any money.
3053962	3060411	I live very humble, I have routines that don't cost anything, you know, walks are free.
3064016	3065958	I would pretty much spend it the same way, honestly.
3067220	3067861	Maybe I would.
3069262	3075904	Maybe I would start some game company on the side, fully run by people while I'm still streaming.
3078545	3081046	Make some games maybe that I can play on stream.
3082467	3083307	Any games, really.
3084848	3086228	I would pretty much live the same way, I think.
3087419	3092963	If Hollywood made a movie about you, what would the title of that movie be?
3093644	3096706	I thought my chat could come up with more stuff than me about this one.
3097027	3097587	We'll ask them.
3099168	3099869	The God game.
3100389	3100749	All right.
3101470	3105413	You don't take too many sponsorships.
3106594	3110577	Still, you decided to give our partnership a try.
3111538	3116922	Can you say why you decided to work with us or what was different?
3118159	3127584	Well, I mean, Elky, a mutual friend of ours, introduced us first and told me about it.
3129686	3135989	And before I decided to hop on the train, I tried out your product for a month off stream.
3138230	3150173	And to me, it was a very good substitute for coffee because I like to take it a little bit into the stream and I don't like hassling with coffee during that.
3150353	3152694	It's just more convenient and I'm really lazy.
3152774	3155495	So it's just better for me.
3157335	3166938	And, you know, on top of that, adding the nutrients and stuff and vitamins and stuff on top of the caffeine is an extra added bonus for me.
3169096	3171337	It worked for me and I've been using it now for a year.
3172177	3185901	And how do you feel, what do you think about the brand MadMonq and this goal of actually pushing gamers for healthier lives, both physically and mentally?
3186241	3187341	Does it resonate?
3187861	3190782	Maybe I will rephrase the question and I'll just keep it simple.
3192383	3196604	So what do you think about our brand and what are we trying to do in the gaming world?
3197375	3202218	Well, you're trying to increase and help out with people's health.
3203639	3206381	Gamers aren't the healthiest of people, as we all know.
3206901	3213185	And I come to realize this during my years of gaming that we're all so lazy, right?
3214346	3215707	That's part of it.
3216408	3224313	And whatever little thing we can do that doesn't take too much of our energy and time,
3226235	3226875	We gladly do.
3227396	3239327	So I think it's very good focusing on the health aspect of gaming because I don't think people should play as much as they do or they should be in front of the computer as much as they do, but they do.
3239487	3247415	So whatever can help with your intake of whatever your body needs or whatever your mind needs, it's good.
3249198	3257259	And looking into the future, how do you feel the health of gamers, both physical and mental, is going to develop?
3258763	3267485	Honestly, I think it's pretty downhill from here for most gamers because, you know, everything is becoming more convenient.
3267525	3273366	You can order food, you can order your groceries, soon you won't be able to, you know, you don't have to leave your house.
3274486	3284888	So, it's important that people realize this themselves and, you know, take some actions and go for walks and take supplements if you need it, you know, if you don't eat properly, you know.
3286869	3293155	Do whatever fits your schedule, whatever helps you boost your health.
3293415	3300642	Because I don't think people should necessarily stop gaming, just compensate with other stuff along with it.
3301102	3305567	So what is too much gaming?
3306367	3308810	How would you define it for yourself right now?
3309366	3317972	Too much gaming, I don't think it's a fixed number of hours or anything like that.
3319673	3324296	I think it's when you start feeling bad and you are not enjoying gaming as much.
3324856	3325817	That's when it's too much.
3327198	3328199	You should refresh.
3331308	3338593	You know, go outside sounds cliche, but, you know, it works unless you live in dark Sweden, you know.
3339113	3340334	OK, maybe not that part.
3340374	3342876	But but yeah.
3350588	3363932	Apart from going on walks, having a fixed streaming schedule and taking MadMonq and Champion, what are other ways that you think about your health?
3368382	3369562	I barely eat any sugar.
3371903	3377065	And if I do, it's, you know, from fruit juice.
3377125	3378025	Yeah, exactly.
3378765	3379946	But not that much anymore.
3380666	3384667	I try to really, really limit my sugar intake.
3384687	3387328	So no chips, no candies, no sodas.
3390387	3393051	And you get used to it, you know, and you feel better.
3394513	3395695	Sleep is very important too.
3398359	3398960	How long do you sleep?
3400222	3405129	Not enough, but that's because of, you know, dogs.
3405390	3406131	Interviews like this.
3408759	3414265	It's hard to get proper sleep in a capital, I think.
3415466	3418449	I think you need to move outside of a capital to get really good sleep.
3419630	3427938	If you don't sleep well, what do you observe on yourself when you don't sleep well?
3431311	3436816	Well, focus, my focusing times become shorter and shorter.
3440459	3440919	Eyes hurt.
3444302	3446604	Yeah, the usual stuff, you know, concentration.
3448685	3448925	Yeah.
3449566	3450427	Thanks a lot, Sebastian.
3451147	3451448	Thank you.
3451468	3453389	It was a pleasure talking.
3454270	3455291	Let's do this again.
3455751	3456171	Absolutely.
3456552	3456752	Thanks.
