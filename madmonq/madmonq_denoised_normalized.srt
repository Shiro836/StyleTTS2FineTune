1
00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:00,590
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not know me.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I'm Forsen, the dankest streamer on Twitch, of course.

3
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's pretty much who I am.

4
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:12,997
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so you stream games for a living?

5
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:13,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

6
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:16,519
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously this is the beginning.

7
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:20,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe before... So this is going to be a free conversation.

8
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,743
[SPEAKER_01]: We will probably jump around from one topic to another.

9
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:27,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Sebastian, I know that you were a Strayed 8 student.

10
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,606
[SPEAKER_00]: So Strayed 8.

11
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:30,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.

12
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:35,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had two subjects that I had the second best grade in.

13
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:36,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

14
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:41,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And was it because you were not good enough in those subjects or was it something else?

15
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:46,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one of them, one of them was physical education.

16
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:53,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some asthma growing up, so surprised that the computer nerd with asthma didn't make the best grade.

17
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:57,608
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other one was chemistry.

18
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:01,510
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that was unfair.

19
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:05,012
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that, you know, they had a shitty teacher.

20
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:05,993
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they got their grade.

21
00:01:06,053 --> 00:01:11,316
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think my teacher was a substitute teacher that year, actually.

22
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:26,208
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very young, like 24 or something, I don't remember, but I think I corrected him once or twice in a lesson and that was like not the best idea to do, even if it's, you know, correct.

23
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:29,450
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ended up being the second best grade.

24
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,474
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he liked me very much, but it is what it is.

25
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:41,180
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right, apart from chemistry and PE, straight A's, what led you to actually go for the straight A's?

26
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it was a couple of things.

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:02:00,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a shit ton of games growing up and I know that a lot of people have these nagging parents where you're not allowed to play games, they will shut off your internet and I've heard all of these stories from friends and whatnot.

28
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:09,592
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother said that I could play as much games as I want as long as I have the best grades.

29
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:15,918
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was like a deal between us, which worked out very well.

30
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:19,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little drama revolving my computer gaming.

31
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:26,066
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the fact that once I started going for these highest grades, I had, you know,

32
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:30,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Friends that also was going for the highest grade.

33
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:36,415
[SPEAKER_00]: So it became somewhat of a friendly competition, you know, where the punishment was banter.

34
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:47,885
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fucked up a test or report or, you know, so it became, you know, a little bit of both, you know, the fact that you're allowed to play as much games as you want and competition wise.

35
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:55,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you describe your childhood was then all just studying and gaming?

36
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:59,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would say exclusively gaming and studying.

37
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:06,901
[SPEAKER_00]: But it helps that you're smart, so a bit more gaming than studying.

38
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of games and gaming, were you also on the top?

39
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:14,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you also the best?

40
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:19,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've always had an easy time with games.

41
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:21,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I started playing at a very young age, right?

42
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:25,731
[SPEAKER_00]: You had friends who also played games, so it became a lot of gaming.

43
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:31,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured out that I was pretty good at games and still am.

44
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:38,088
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say pretty good at games, what did you feel that you did differently than others that you had?

45
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:58,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that what it comes down to in games is there are, of course, different genres, but if you want to be good at several genres of games, you have to have a pretty good pattern recognition, logical thinking.

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the foundations, I think.

47
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:08,386
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to pick up on what works and what doesn't work very fast whenever you're learning a new game genre.

48
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:21,299
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be very good at one specific game if you have good reactions or if you're fast with your fingers, you can be good at RTS.

49
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:30,689
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends, but if you want to be good at several games, it has to be logical thinking, I think, which is the most important one.

50
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:35,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so do you remember any unhappy times?

51
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:40,378
[SPEAKER_01]: For example here in Stockholm or then later when you moved to Spain?

52
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:41,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Unhappy times?

53
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:53,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't grow up with... Both of my parents were into real estate.

54
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:56,676
[SPEAKER_00]: They worked with real estate quite heavily.

55
00:04:57,176 --> 00:05:06,117
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the early 90s, there was a real estate crash where everyone basically lost everything if you were leveraged.

56
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:09,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people were because the banks were lending out a lot of money.

57
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:12,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Four real estate projects and stuff back then.

58
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,880
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing up,

59
00:05:17,522 --> 00:05:19,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the most money.

60
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, everything is relative.

61
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:29,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I still lived in Sweden, which was lucky, I guess, compared to other countries.

62
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,633
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, if you compare it to your surroundings, it wasn't that much.

63
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Which you always do as a person.

64
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course.

65
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:42,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say that the experience of not having...

66
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

67
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I believe that growing up tough skin and being resilient is 10% nature, 9% nurture.

68
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:23,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're very heavily affected by your surroundings and obviously if you grow up with little money then your goal is going to be to make a lot of money later in life, right?

69
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:28,826
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to feel this your entire life, right?

70
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,127
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense that

71
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:34,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally had that as a goal.

72
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,474
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a specific job I wanted to do.

73
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:42,837
[SPEAKER_00]: It kept going from whatever job I found out made the most money, you know.

74
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:47,139
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal was always to get rich.

75
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,421
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you be more specific?

76
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:52,382
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of, you know, jokes were you actually thinking about?

77
00:06:52,402 --> 00:07:00,107
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, first it was, you know, doctors were earning this and then corporate lawyers I found out.

78
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:06,090
[SPEAKER_00]: At the age of 10, they were earning a lot of money defending these big companies.

79
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:11,414
[SPEAKER_00]: It just went to whatever is the highest paying.

80
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:20,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on in life, you realize that finance and those kind of things in general is the big givers.

81
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:30,402
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to one of the best schools in Sweden, real estate and finance.

82
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:47,266
[SPEAKER_00]: I studied before I started streaming because I realized that streaming was jumping 15 years ahead in the career ladder, you know, and then I could make my own choices even if I wanted to do what I was studying later on.

83
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:57,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to games, so obviously this is something that you were doing from the age of five until now, now you're 30, 31?

84
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:00,837
[SPEAKER_01]: 31, yes, unfortunately.

85
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:05,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you still enjoy gaming?

86
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:09,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I still love gaming, it's still my biggest hobby.

87
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,421
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did a pretty good job at

88
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:22,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping it a hobby instead of turning it into a full-fledged job.

89
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:30,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take the streaming part as serious as I take the gaming part.

90
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,251
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still enjoying games.

91
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:36,614
[SPEAKER_00]: I will probably still game when I'm 60, I think.

92
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:42,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of

93
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:55,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you were thinking about becoming a doctor or a corporate lawyer, was there a time or around that time when you thought, all right, I can actually make money out of gaming?

94
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:20,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the goal was always to get into a very good school and then finish university and get a good job at some place, climb the career ladder and be wealthy by the time I'm, you know, 40 plus or something, which is usually how it goes.

95
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Or real wealthy then, if you're lucky.

96
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,034
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I still always play games through my entire life, right?

97
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:45,420
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a point where I was playing StarCraft and I saw all these prize pools and I'm thinking to myself, hey, maybe it's fucking 2011 or 10 or whatever.

98
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can earn a lot of money playing video games nowadays, which was stupid sounding back then, honestly.

99
00:09:54,486 --> 00:10:02,455
[SPEAKER_00]: All I have to do is win all these tournaments with these hundreds and thousands of dollars in prize pools and it will be easy.

100
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do what I like and earn money.

101
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:10,183
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the Koreans came and that's not possible.

102
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,107
[SPEAKER_00]: No one can win that much unless you put in

103
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:20,891
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 hours a day and it's not reasonable in the long run.

104
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:25,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So I quickly gave up on playing games professionally.

105
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:36,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did see a few years later, though, a chance of earning money as a content creator instead.

106
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:42,087
[SPEAKER_01]: With StarCraft and just, you know, understanding that, hey, this is probably a dead end for me.

107
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:44,089
[SPEAKER_01]: How quickly did you realize this?

108
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it did take some years.

109
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't remember if it was 2012 or 2013, but

110
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Between two and three years, it was still fun to play and it was still fun to go on tournaments and stuff.

111
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:04,487
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't something that you can do in the long run.

112
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:08,210
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to start thinking about your future at one point.

113
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I went back to school.

114
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:15,215
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing during school to university.

115
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,257
[SPEAKER_00]: But this time with a serious outlook on school.

116
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:36,266
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I saw, you know, an opportunity with streaming when I was almost done with school and I was like, damn, I could skip 15 years, you know, climbing the company ladder if I just take a shot at the streaming thing right now.

117
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,567
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to be now or never.

118
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:44,491
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I ditched the last course I had before my exam, you know, graduation.

119
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:45,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember?

120
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:46,712
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the last course?

121
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:47,953
[SPEAKER_00]: It was statistics.

122
00:11:48,574 --> 00:12:01,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I love statistics and it's implemented into... It was one of the reasons why I became so good with Hearthstone, counting cards and the chances of getting the exact cards you need remaining in your deck.

123
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:06,907
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, but the university statistics is a little bit too over-exaggerated.

124
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:11,170
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really implemented the same way as the lesser stuff.

125
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,791
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more the...

126
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:20,897
[SPEAKER_00]: The calculators and the pre-programmed, you know, formulas and stuff using that.

127
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:25,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I didn't finish that course, but it was the last course I had.

128
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:32,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So you realized, first you realized that there is no future in StarCraft for you.

129
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:36,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you realized that, hey, there is this chance, you know, jumping at...

130
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,812
[SPEAKER_01]: This streaming or gaming or content creating bandwagon and actually making some money.

131
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:42,153
[SPEAKER_01]: So you turn to this.

132
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:58,341
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I actually read in one of the, I don't think it was an interview, but I think it was a transcript of one of your streams when you also really quickly realized that within streaming, if you are chasing viewership money,

133
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:03,600
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also a very dangerous road to go on.

134
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you speak a little bit about this?

135
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:07,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.

136
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:13,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, as I said before, my goal was always to become rich.

137
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:21,092
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in my first couple of years of streaming, I still had that mentality.

138
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:23,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still chasing, you know,

139
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:33,480
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher viewership, you know, the sponsors and all the events and all that.

140
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:40,065
[SPEAKER_00]: But I quickly realized that, you know, like it's a never ending battle.

141
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:47,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I vividly remember counting like, oh, my God, I am earning $5,000 a month playing video games for a living.

142
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:50,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, I'm earning $10,000 playing video games for a living.

143
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:56,058
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh my god, I'm earning $15,000 a month playing video games for a living.

144
00:13:56,598 --> 00:14:06,485
[SPEAKER_00]: But I realized this is the never-ending battle of dopamine rushes that will eventually give you diminishing returns.

145
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,512
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you are already the 1%, top 1%, right?

146
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:14,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you have to be the top 0.1%?

147
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:26,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's better to be completely, you know, stress-free, completely, you know, relaxed and happy in your life.

148
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:34,490
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to enjoy being the 1% than being stressed at the top 0.1% or 0.01% or whatever it is you're chasing, right?

149
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:46,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you are completely stress-free in your life, you don't even need that much money.

150
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:58,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even the most ordinary life, when it's completely stress-free, you have no anxiety or anything, it becomes a pretty good life, even without all the materialistic things.

151
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:16,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is very, very rare that you can be so conscious about making this decision at the very early stage because I think many people realize this a little bit later in life when

152
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:27,831
[SPEAKER_01]: There is either no damage that was already done to their private life, to their health, or there's basically no turning back.

153
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:32,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do you think that you saw it before it actually happened?

154
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:41,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I realized that it was like any other addiction and the sooner you break an addiction, the easier it becomes to break it.

155
00:15:42,659 --> 00:16:01,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you realize that, you know, you are never going to stop chasing the next goal early on, it becomes that much easier to just stop right there, be happy with what you got and just like,

156
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:03,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what makes you happy.

157
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Play what makes you happy.

158
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cater to other people.

159
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:12,461
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already earning a lot.

160
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Just play what you want to play.

161
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Be stress-free in your life.

162
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:18,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Take days off when you want to take days off.

163
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:22,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything for anyone else.

164
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:30,713
[SPEAKER_00]: People sometimes feel like they owe your audience something, but you really don't.

165
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:38,724
[SPEAKER_00]: They made you who you are, but they didn't do it out of their own kind, free will.

166
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:40,725
[SPEAKER_00]: They were entertained by what you did.

167
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,646
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mutual thing.

168
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:50,990
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of streamers feel like they owe their audience to be live every day and do long streams.

169
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:52,951
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality,

170
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:08,372
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a mutual growth when it comes to the stream and you should just do what makes you happy because in the long run you're gonna burn yourself out chasing that stuff and it's a never-ending battle.

171
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:28,221
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I, you know, when I talk to you, this is, I think, a pattern, you know, we talked before that I see that is really repeating that you see something, you are super aware to actually take a step back and look at the situation, kind of analyze which direction, you know, you would probably be going.

172
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:34,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think actually many people have this ability or they realize it a little bit later.

173
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:37,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you maybe have some advice?

174
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:47,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems that you are super aware of when you're speaking about stress, you're speaking about anxiety, you're speaking about stress-free, which can translate to being happy.

175
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:51,059
[SPEAKER_01]: So you seem to be super aware of what is happening.

176
00:17:52,360 --> 00:18:05,082
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice would you have for people, how to make the step back, how to actually realize that something is happening that may not be the best for them?

177
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:09,683
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very hard.

178
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:14,904
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are stressed, a lot of people are depressed.

179
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:17,905
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a hard time pinpointing why.

180
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:37,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's hard for a lot of people to stop caring about stuff and become stress free because people are lonely, right?

181
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:44,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to fit in with other people, they need to care about

182
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:46,875
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what they care about.

183
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:53,857
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's things, if you are in a group where people are chasing, you know, success.

184
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:57,118
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to chase success.

185
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:01,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you know, you're going to be shunned out of the group, right?

186
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,760
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a group with people who care about a certain type of politics, you also have to care about that.

187
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:14,984
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a saying that you are the result of the five people that you most frequently interact with.

188
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:27,151
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are in an environment that really cares about this stuff, you automatically care about it yourself, even though if it's not your motivation and it goes against your biology, against your feelings.

189
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:29,853
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, continue.

190
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:42,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's very important to break out of anxiety and depression and stress and all that stuff.

191
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:45,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly because of these factors.

192
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:52,370
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a light at the end of the tunnel too.

193
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,495
[SPEAKER_00]: You're building resilience right now if you are stressed and depressed and whatever.

194
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:00,958
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be the healthiest for your body, but your body is building

195
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:22,724
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you, what would be the advice for people who, because I think at the end of the day, if you feel anxious and you feel unhappy, stressed, that it may be a moment for you to step back and actually become aware of what is happening in your life.

196
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:26,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you hit a really important note by saying that

197
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:37,526
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from actually, not from how you feel, but from what is happening around you and what other people feel about you.

198
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:43,069
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of this, you know, external thing that you might not have under control.

199
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:45,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is a really, really important point.

200
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:52,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you remember when you, was it a gradual process for you to realize that actually- To grow a thick skin, you mean?

201
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:57,616
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow a thick skin, but actually, you know, the beginning, just to start realizing,

202
00:20:58,397 --> 00:20:59,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, it's actually about me.

203
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:11,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's always, not always, sometimes you have this eureka moment, but it's very rare.

204
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:28,482
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more often than not a gradual process where you get thicker skin, but it comes a lot from, you know, reflecting a lot and really thinking about stuff in order to...

205
00:21:30,064 --> 00:21:34,484
[SPEAKER_00]: To become resilient, you have to think about what actually matters.

206
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:50,775
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are anxious and stressed, they think about worst case scenarios and these are like unlikely events, but your brain makes you think that it's the most likely cause to happen, right?

207
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:54,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the worst case usually, because I usually go through that as well.

208
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:58,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And the worst case is usually not something that you cannot reverse.

209
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:00,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can always, you know, take it back.

210
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:02,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like the worst, worst case.

211
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:18,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I mean, there is always, whenever I felt, you know, stressed or whatever in the past, I always felt a little bit good about it though, because I know...

212
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:24,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I knew rather that I was developing, you know, something good out of it.

213
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:28,695
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, next time I will be more resilient or next time I won't make this mistake.

214
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:32,897
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you will always get something good out of every bad situation.

215
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:37,120
[SPEAKER_00]: You will always get something bad out of every good situation, too.

216
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,541
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to think about that.

217
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:44,165
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really interesting point and I think a very valid point.

218
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:47,647
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a research and I think it was done by

219
00:22:49,388 --> 00:22:52,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Mrs. McGonagall, Kate, something like that.

220
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Mrs. McGonagall, is that Harry Potter professor?

221
00:22:55,151 --> 00:23:07,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems like, but she's actually a very profound and prolific writer and she writes about stress and anxiety.

222
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:12,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was writing about the stress for her whole life.

223
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:19,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was one research paper that showed that it's not really stress itself, but it's really how you think about stress.

224
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:24,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you feel and you think about stress that is actually destroying your life, then it will.

225
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:29,844
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you feel that it's something that is actually helping you develop into becoming something better, something stronger,

226
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:31,725
[SPEAKER_01]: It will do that as well.

227
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:39,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's chronic stress and short term stress, but I think how you think about it really, really matters.

228
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:40,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.

229
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:41,433
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.

230
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,614
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the mindset.

231
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:54,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so did you, going into specifics, what did you learn not to do to avoid stress or to feel better?

232
00:23:54,212 --> 00:24:02,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there any particular activities and particular things that you started to avoid or not doing that eventually made you feel better?

233
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:10,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing that comes to mind is, of course,

234
00:24:13,943 --> 00:24:21,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media and just doing browsing, you know, the internet and stuff.

235
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:34,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we as humans, I think technology has developed way faster, way, way, way faster than our, you know, biology as humans can keep up with.

236
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:38,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting too much intake all the time, right?

237
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:41,214
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's tons of research probably done on this.

238
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,395
[SPEAKER_00]: But I truly believe that

239
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:51,723
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting too much impressions all the time from the internet.

240
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:58,489
[SPEAKER_00]: These are advice that a lot of people know about, but maybe they don't do it yet.

241
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,193
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, don't bring your phone into bed, right?

242
00:25:04,495 --> 00:25:07,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid anything that interrupts your sleep at best.

243
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:10,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep your phone on.

244
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:14,989
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing is if you can just cut out social media altogether.

245
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:22,719
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people feel pressured to do it because that's something to talk about amongst your circle of friends.

246
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's just online friends, right?

247
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:35,945
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep up with what's happening in your little gaming world or Bitcoin world or whatever circle you're into, right?

248
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:42,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So they feel forced to do it, but it's really not good for you, is what I believe.

249
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:43,768
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's...

250
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:49,971
[SPEAKER_00]: They end up bringing it to bed and they end up sleeping poorly because of it, right?

251
00:25:50,111 --> 00:25:52,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And sleep is so important.

252
00:25:52,392 --> 00:25:55,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not only that.

253
00:25:55,213 --> 00:25:58,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a lot about, you know, basically these technologies.

254
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:04,917
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just hitting the nail on the head with the technology versus our biology.

255
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:05,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Our biology didn't...

256
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:08,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're on our way to see Forsen.

257
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:10,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, I am Forsen, the best gamer in the world.

258
00:26:35,402 --> 00:26:46,692
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a hard time and I think limiting it because it's tough to just cut yourself off completely but limiting is definitely one of the things to do.

259
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:49,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and not just social media.

260
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:55,960
[SPEAKER_00]: People are working now, for example, with these flex work hours from home and they're always...

261
00:26:57,901 --> 00:27:05,247
[SPEAKER_00]: They always have their emails or business or working emails connected to their phones at all times of the day.

262
00:27:06,648 --> 00:27:12,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Job no longer becomes a routine, it becomes spread out, scattered all over the day.

263
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:15,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very important to have routines.

264
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:18,276
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's how we're supposed to function.

265
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:25,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can change routines and biological clocks a little bit over time.

266
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:29,653
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in general, you should have set times of the day.

267
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body really enjoys knowing what happens next.

268
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:38,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Not eating randomly at random hours, it fucks up your whole thing.

269
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:49,775
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think routine is very important and technology really ruins that when everything is available at all times and, you know.

270
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:50,876
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps you distracted.

271
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:51,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

272
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:53,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfocused, definitely.

273
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:57,162
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so you've...

274
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:04,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get back to speaking about routines because I think this is a big topic.

275
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:16,101
[SPEAKER_01]: But could you tell me a story when you made a big mistake which eventually turned into a really, really valuable lesson for you?

276
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:23,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I learned something from every mistake.

277
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:24,246
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say...

278
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:42,129
[SPEAKER_00]: A big specific one, but I remember as a kid playing poker, or sorry, that poker boom had just started, right?

279
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I was so good at games so I could become as good as this too, you know?

280
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:48,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bought some poker...

281
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:55,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I love literature and theory and I knew it by heart.

282
00:28:56,016 --> 00:29:01,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I could close the book and I could tell you exactly what you should do with every hand on every position of the board.

283
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:06,631
[SPEAKER_00]: But once, and I played like perfectly with play money.

284
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:18,216
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I inserted $100, you know, at the age of 12 or whatever, which is a lot back then to play with.

285
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:22,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And I lost it all playing with real money.

286
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,564
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had such anxiety over it and stress over it because, you know, I didn't know what happened.

287
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:37,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I played so bad, even though I played everything perfectly on the play money and theory and I...

288
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:47,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that, you know, you can't become good at something without doing it in practice, you know.

289
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:58,322
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do skydiving theory all you want, but you have to jump out of that plane, you know, to really learn skydiving, right?

290
00:29:58,642 --> 00:29:59,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully succeed.

291
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:00,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and hopefully succeed.

292
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:02,945
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best meal that you can do?

293
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:05,566
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best meal I can do?

294
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,787
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty good at the steaks.

295
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:09,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Steaks?

296
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I always get them perfectly.

297
00:30:11,628 --> 00:30:17,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it just a simple meat and salt or do you have any special Forsen sauce?

298
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,491
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a sauce person.

299
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:22,011
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat almost any sauce.

300
00:30:23,492 --> 00:30:29,374
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just like if you make the steak well, that's saucy enough.

301
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:38,515
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and do you have any special pans or any just a regular pan, piece of meat?

302
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they're called.

303
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:43,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so tell me the recipe.

304
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:52,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, you take out the steak and you throw some butter and some oil in the pan.

305
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:54,979
[SPEAKER_00]: High heat, of course.

306
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:56,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Some salt and pepper.

307
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:59,300
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really eat salt that much anymore.

308
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,940
[SPEAKER_01]: On the steak?

309
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:02,866
[SPEAKER_00]: On the steak, yes, of course, yes.

310
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:04,247
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's in the pan.

311
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:05,147
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's in the pan.

312
00:31:05,668 --> 00:31:06,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in the pan.

313
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:19,217
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just, depending on how you like it done, but I like my medium rare, so it's... Yeah, so it's very high heat, flip it once each side, right?

314
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:28,603
[SPEAKER_00]: You slice up some potatoes, long slices, circular, put it in the oven, do some olive oil.

315
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:31,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to salt, but I don't salt really anymore.

316
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:40,191
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're done, you put in some extra butter in the pan with the meat and some cream and make a little bit of sauce out of that.

317
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:48,678
[SPEAKER_01]: My trick is then use a little bit of garlic, but just smash the garlic, don't cut it because you can burn it very, very, very easily.

318
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:54,462
[SPEAKER_01]: But even then put it and just put the buttery, garlicky stuff on the steak, then it's delicious.

319
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's good stuff.

320
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:57,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't...

321
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:08,174
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad to cut out salt but it's actually really good because you need so little salt once you get used to it for it to be the same.

322
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:17,801
[SPEAKER_01]: But here I think we would disagree a little bit because I am a big believer in salt.

323
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:21,524
[SPEAKER_01]: So salt is actually, if you don't have of course there is health issues.

324
00:32:22,344 --> 00:32:32,692
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have metabolic syndrome, if you are not living a very healthy life, then salt can be detrimental in terms of higher blood pressure and stuff like this.

325
00:32:33,773 --> 00:32:36,735
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually you need salt and you need a lot of it.

326
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:38,456
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am a fan of salt.

327
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:45,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not a scientist myself, so I cannot say, I can just say what, you know, a lot of scientists have said in the past.

328
00:32:46,081 --> 00:32:52,806
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, these things change all the time, you know, everything that gives you cancer and now it doesn't give you cancer, you know.

329
00:32:53,386 --> 00:33:00,331
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to follow, but I feel like there's a lot of salt added into products anyway.

330
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:06,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Added salt is, I don't think, the most necessary thing, but I don't think it kills you.

331
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:24,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel, you know, if you look at the obvious risks of streaming and I, you know, I always say this to all of our streamers that you are really fighting against your biology because usually you are streaming at night.

332
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:34,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually there's like big lights shining at you which messes up your, as you said, circadian rhythms and biology and all sorts of stuff.

333
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:35,408
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also the

334
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:36,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here to talk about Dopamine Rush.

335
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:42,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dopamine Rush is that you mentioned with, you know, viewers looking at the viewer count, donations, subscriptions.

336
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:46,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a tough job, you know, mentally and actually to keep sane.

337
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:49,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think many people get gobbled up.

338
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:11,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Any advice for people to actually, this is not a good question, but do you see a mistake or a pattern that is happening again and again with people that are streaming and then they later on pay the price?

339
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:14,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course.

340
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:28,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not really that much of a mistake, but whatever you do at the start of your streaming career sets the tone for the remainder.

341
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:37,562
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard for streamers to break free from something if it takes too long for them to realize.

342
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,505
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of streamers can be stuck with one game

343
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever, because, you know, they jumped ship

344
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:51,454
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, too late and it didn't work out and, you know, they go back and forth.

345
00:34:51,714 --> 00:35:00,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of streamers, I think they need to set the atmosphere early on.

346
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:04,058
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hard because when you're a new streamer, what's working is working.

347
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:05,599
[SPEAKER_00]: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

348
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:11,121
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there will be a point in time where you might want to do something else.

349
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,802
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't already set the...

350
00:35:16,202 --> 00:35:18,603
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question for you guys.

351
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:19,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question for you guys.

352
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:21,463
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question for you guys.

353
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:50,192
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are things like that, of course, for new streamers.

354
00:35:54,216 --> 00:36:05,748
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other life hacks, of course, where if you know you're going to have a bad day streaming, there's some other big streamer, you know,

355
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:15,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Streaming in your place and is doing some big event or something, you know, one of your competitors.

356
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:20,519
[SPEAKER_00]: People often say, oh, be consistent, stream every day, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

357
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:26,501
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it's better not to stream those days if you are thinking about your viewership and all that stuff.

358
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:33,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think it was Soda Poppin who said, you're only as good as your last two streams, which I actually agree with quite a lot.

359
00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:39,005
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only as good as your last two streams because those are the streams that the people remember.

360
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:44,307
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have like really bad streams, it can really affect your whole channel like negatively.

361
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:50,590
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is only if you're in it for the grind game and for the climbing the viewer ladder and stuff like that.

362
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:58,053
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people make this mistake thinking that consistency is the most important thing when in fact, playing it smart is the most important thing.

363
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,476
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, all right.

364
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:15,531
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, understanding where you come from and how you, you know, throughout the years, where of, you know, your mental situation developing, how you developed some resilience, mental toughness.

365
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,377
[SPEAKER_01]: The question that comes to mind is what was first?

366
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Forsen or the Forsen Vice?

367
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:31,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the, you know, did the community find you and because they are so engaging

368
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:35,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I understand the question.

369
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:39,138
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the chicken or the egg.

370
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:53,781
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously the community started to form like this because of my lack of care, so to speak, about a lot of things.

371
00:37:55,101 --> 00:38:03,906
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not care about moderation or political topics or anything like that.

372
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:08,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously then the community forms based on that.

373
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:17,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, my resilience forms because of that community towards that type of community.

374
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:19,475
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was a process of...

375
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:27,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So the community shaped you, but you also kind of shaped the group.

376
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:29,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was the egg.

377
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:30,438
[SPEAKER_00]: I was first.

378
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:34,880
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the hen laid the next egg, right?

379
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

380
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:44,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see any development with the community or did you have any clashes throughout the year that come to mind?

381
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I clash with them all the time because I think it's fun.

382
00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:56,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fun to piss them off and they think it's fun to piss me off.

383
00:38:58,015 --> 00:38:59,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Any examples that come to mind?

384
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:05,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, it's just a constant banter, really.

385
00:39:09,606 --> 00:39:13,170
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no specifics, just a constant banter.

386
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:19,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I like playing what I feel like playing.

387
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:24,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't like that and there's an issue at hand.

388
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:30,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately for them, I have the final say, so I always win.

389
00:39:32,443 --> 00:39:33,443
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's fun for them to try.

390
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:40,357
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question is what game character do you most identify with and why?

391
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:48,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Kratos from God of War because he's pretty badass.

392
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:51,865
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a nice beard too.

393
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:54,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see the similarity.

394
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:56,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.

395
00:39:57,047 --> 00:39:58,088
[SPEAKER_00]: I will probably at one point.

396
00:39:58,108 --> 00:39:58,548
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

397
00:39:58,848 --> 00:40:04,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your absolute favorite thing, word or phrase to say right now?

398
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:06,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely.

399
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:09,492
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

400
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:12,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you spend a silly amount of money on?

401
00:40:15,254 --> 00:40:15,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,

402
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:20,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.

403
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:21,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Steak?

404
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:23,556
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not anymore.

405
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:25,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat that much meat anymore.

406
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,942
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't actually spend a silly amount of money on anything, actually.

407
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:39,008
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, games, I would say, but, you know, that's just business, you know, business expenses.

408
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:43,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so why do your friends like you?

409
00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:45,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do my friends like me?

410
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:46,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have to.

411
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:49,409
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known each other since kindergarten, pretty much.

412
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:52,771
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not their choice.

413
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:59,355
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could design a perfect game for yourself, what would it look like?

414
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:08,120
[SPEAKER_00]: For myself, it would be some competitive game.

415
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:13,523
[SPEAKER_00]: The genre, I don't know.

416
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:18,900
[SPEAKER_00]: A very nice competitive game.

417
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

418
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:27,966
[SPEAKER_00]: My head is like for the stream, for playing on stream, for playing off stream.

419
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,226
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for yourself.

420
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:31,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Only for myself.

421
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:33,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're banned from Twitch.

422
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:33,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

423
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,871
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can enjoy your game in peace.

424
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:38,873
[SPEAKER_01]: What game are you playing?

425
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:41,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I would play something competitive.

426
00:41:45,307 --> 00:41:52,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably FPS, I think, if I had to pick a genre, but a card game could work too.

427
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, describe your life in one Twitch emote.

428
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems good, man.

429
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:08,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, if you could reincarnate as anything, a thing, a person, an animal, what would it be?

430
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:10,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a dog, I think.

431
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:16,510
[SPEAKER_00]: I think dogs with owners, good owners, live pretty good lives.

432
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:22,616
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stress-free and they have short lives, but not to them, you know.

433
00:42:23,797 --> 00:42:25,478
[SPEAKER_00]: To them, it's just an ordinary life.

434
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:29,422
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a dog would be my choice.

435
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:33,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, what do you think hell would look like for you?

436
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,391
[SPEAKER_00]: What hell would look like for me?

437
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:41,194
[SPEAKER_00]: On a serious note, maybe being in an actual asylum.

438
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:52,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you are not mentally insane, but everyone does believe it and you're forced to be in an asylum, I think that's a very scary situation.

439
00:42:55,803 --> 00:42:57,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically enough, yeah.

440
00:42:59,031 --> 00:42:59,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

441
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:05,658
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could time travel, what time would you like to go to but permanently?

442
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,480
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot go back.

443
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Permanently.

444
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:08,822
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

445
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:09,422
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

446
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:27,626
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably go back to maybe the 50s because that's far enough away from the internet that I wouldn't care that much once I got to that age.

447
00:43:29,027 --> 00:43:33,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the 50s were a good time living through all the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.

448
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:34,108
[SPEAKER_00]: As a real estate investor.

449
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:42,517
[SPEAKER_00]: As a whatever, I'm a plumber even, you know, like I think it's just better times back then.

450
00:43:43,177 --> 00:43:45,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

451
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:48,842
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the most challenging thing about being yourself?

452
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:53,025
[SPEAKER_00]: The most challenging thing about being myself?

453
00:43:54,746 --> 00:43:57,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Being so goddamn good at every game, you know.

454
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,452
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no progress, I'm just the best instantly.

455
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:05,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, what do you consider your best investment so far?

456
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:09,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be in yourself, money investment, buying a book, learning a new skill.

457
00:44:10,653 --> 00:44:12,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Best investment in myself?

458
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:17,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my first microphone and webcam for streaming, I guess.

459
00:44:18,897 --> 00:44:19,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Good answer.

460
00:44:20,198 --> 00:44:23,199
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was your most valuable failure?

461
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:25,540
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that you learned the most from?

462
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:27,241
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did you learn?

463
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:30,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh...

464
00:44:33,484 --> 00:44:39,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say that one of them was the poker thingy.

465
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:51,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so except salt in the past two years, is there anything particular that you completely changed your mind about?

466
00:44:52,870 --> 00:45:08,021
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last two years, I don't think I changed my mind about anything in specific, but, you know, last five years or five to six years, I've changed my mind about, you know,

467
00:45:10,363 --> 00:45:15,905
[SPEAKER_00]: What the end goal of life is, you know, not about climbing the success ladder, as we talked about earlier.

468
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:31,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like a gradual thing that you come to realize with wisdom and age that you have to be happy about the situation, you know, instead of chasing potential

469
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:36,835
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the worst advice commonly given out in your field that you think is completely useless?

470
00:45:49,507 --> 00:45:59,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I see a lot of people being burnt out on a specific game or just streaming in general.

471
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:06,421
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I see all these people replying that, you know, take off or play whatever you want.

472
00:46:06,641 --> 00:46:11,145
[SPEAKER_00]: We still, you know, we still watch whatever you want to do, you know.

473
00:46:11,745 --> 00:46:22,274
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving advice as a hive mind when in reality they're all separate beings and it's just a shitty advice for streamers to listen to in general.

474
00:46:22,314 --> 00:46:33,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they should do whatever they want but they have to truly believe it themselves and not believe that their audience will be there for them at any given time.

475
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:40,227
[SPEAKER_01]: In recent times, is there anything you have become better at saying no to?

476
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:41,007
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

477
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,314
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you learn from games that you apply in real life?

478
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:51,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing up, it was English.

479
00:46:53,234 --> 00:47:04,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I think that playing games keeps the logical thinking part of your brain active, which is applied in real life too, right?

480
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:10,458
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you keep that part of your brain active, it's good for real life stuff too.

481
00:47:11,598 --> 00:47:14,099
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the one thing you would like to change about yourself?

482
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, nothing.

483
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:26,311
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do when you feel unfocused, distracted or overwhelmed?

484
00:47:27,131 --> 00:47:33,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get stressed or overwhelmed that often or anxiety.

485
00:47:34,877 --> 00:47:48,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I guess my stream knows this, but whenever I get like tech issues and stuff, I can't stand it when 500 different people are trying to give you

486
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:55,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Different advice on how to fix something tech related and I have no clue what I'm doing.

487
00:47:56,355 --> 00:48:02,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's taking away from the game on what to play, you know, like the fucking this hassle.

488
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,742
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, nope, shut down.

489
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,645
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do this tomorrow with a new mindset.

490
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:08,946
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done with this right now.

491
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do this, you know, off stream or tomorrow.

492
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:20,441
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of like just push it forward and prevent myself from, you know, becoming too stressed about anything.

493
00:48:20,842 --> 00:48:21,703
[SPEAKER_01]: And you like to change that?

494
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,255
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to change that.

495
00:48:25,675 --> 00:48:26,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good method.

496
00:48:27,836 --> 00:48:29,417
[SPEAKER_00]: You push it a little bit.

497
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,558
[SPEAKER_00]: People push things too far into the future.

498
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:45,944
[SPEAKER_00]: But just, you know, if you're overwhelmed by something, just leave it until after you fucking slept or after you ate or after you went for a walk or something, you know, don't do it in the moment.

499
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:47,625
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't push it too far.

500
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:52,047
[SPEAKER_01]: In what situations do you doubt yourself the most?

501
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:55,553
[SPEAKER_00]: In what situations do I doubt myself the most?

502
00:48:56,153 --> 00:48:57,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Apart from the technical stuff.

503
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:04,620
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm not pretending and I'm actually bad at a game, then I'm doubting myself.

504
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:10,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, what do you do when you need to boost your confidence?

505
00:49:10,245 --> 00:49:11,846
[SPEAKER_00]: I play a game I'm better at.

506
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:16,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so maintaining control.

507
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:16,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

508
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,753
[SPEAKER_01]: In what situations do you feel that you have the most control?

509
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.

510
00:49:25,821 --> 00:49:27,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel like I'm in control.

511
00:49:28,823 --> 00:49:31,244
[SPEAKER_00]: On a more serious note, right?

512
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:36,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I play a game, I'm good at... I'm in control.

513
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:37,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so playing games.

514
00:49:37,727 --> 00:49:38,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, playing games.

515
00:49:40,532 --> 00:49:48,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to give a TED talk on anything but your primary focus, which is streaming and games, what would it be?

516
00:49:49,304 --> 00:49:54,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to look up a lot of terms and whatnot, but the general philosophy

517
00:49:55,752 --> 00:50:05,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I never read any philosophy, but everything I have ever thought of, there is a philosopher who thought of it before, right?

518
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:07,796
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have terms for it.

519
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:16,220
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, I think philosophy is a fairly interesting topic.

520
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:16,860
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

521
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:25,423
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing what you know now, what advice would you give to a five years or ten years younger version of yourself?

522
00:50:27,634 --> 00:50:28,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Invest in Amazon?

523
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:31,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Good answer.

524
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:33,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Good answer.

525
00:50:33,356 --> 00:50:33,717
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

526
00:50:34,337 --> 00:50:42,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you spend your life if you had $100 million in your bank account right now?

527
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:45,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning you don't have to care about money.

528
00:50:48,222 --> 00:50:48,843
[SPEAKER_00]: The same way.

529
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:52,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely spend any money.

530
00:50:53,962 --> 00:51:00,411
[SPEAKER_00]: I live very humble, I have routines that don't cost anything, you know, walks are free.

531
00:51:04,016 --> 00:51:05,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pretty much spend it the same way, honestly.

532
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:07,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I would.

533
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:15,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I would start some game company on the side, fully run by people while I'm still streaming.

534
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:21,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some games maybe that I can play on stream.

535
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:23,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Any games, really.

536
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pretty much live the same way, I think.

537
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:32,963
[SPEAKER_01]: If Hollywood made a movie about you, what would the title of that movie be?

538
00:51:33,644 --> 00:51:36,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought my chat could come up with more stuff than me about this one.

539
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:37,587
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll ask them.

540
00:51:39,168 --> 00:51:39,869
[SPEAKER_00]: The God game.

541
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:40,749
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

542
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:45,413
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't take too many sponsorships.

543
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:50,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, you decided to give our partnership a try.

544
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:56,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you say why you decided to work with us or what was different?

545
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:07,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, Elky, a mutual friend of ours, introduced us first and told me about it.

546
00:52:09,686 --> 00:52:15,989
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I decided to hop on the train, I tried out your product for a month off stream.

547
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:30,173
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it was a very good substitute for coffee because I like to take it a little bit into the stream and I don't like hassling with coffee during that.

548
00:52:30,353 --> 00:52:32,694
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more convenient and I'm really lazy.

549
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just better for me.

550
00:52:37,335 --> 00:52:46,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, on top of that, adding the nutrients and stuff and vitamins and stuff on top of the caffeine is an extra added bonus for me.

551
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:51,337
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked for me and I've been using it now for a year.

552
00:52:52,177 --> 00:53:05,901
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you feel, what do you think about the brand MadMonq and this goal of actually pushing gamers for healthier lives, both physically and mentally?

553
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:07,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it resonate?

554
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:10,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I will rephrase the question and I'll just keep it simple.

555
00:53:12,383 --> 00:53:16,604
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think about our brand and what are we trying to do in the gaming world?

556
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:22,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're trying to increase and help out with people's health.

557
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:26,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Gamers aren't the healthiest of people, as we all know.

558
00:53:26,901 --> 00:53:33,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And I come to realize this during my years of gaming that we're all so lazy, right?

559
00:53:34,346 --> 00:53:35,707
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of it.

560
00:53:36,408 --> 00:53:44,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever little thing we can do that doesn't take too much of our energy and time,

561
00:53:46,235 --> 00:53:46,875
[SPEAKER_00]: We gladly do.

562
00:53:47,396 --> 00:53:59,327
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's very good focusing on the health aspect of gaming because I don't think people should play as much as they do or they should be in front of the computer as much as they do, but they do.

563
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:07,415
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever can help with your intake of whatever your body needs or whatever your mind needs, it's good.

564
00:54:09,198 --> 00:54:17,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking into the future, how do you feel the health of gamers, both physical and mental, is going to develop?

565
00:54:18,763 --> 00:54:27,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think it's pretty downhill from here for most gamers because, you know, everything is becoming more convenient.

566
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:33,366
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order food, you can order your groceries, soon you won't be able to, you know, you don't have to leave your house.

567
00:54:34,486 --> 00:54:44,888
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's important that people realize this themselves and, you know, take some actions and go for walks and take supplements if you need it, you know, if you don't eat properly, you know.

568
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:53,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever fits your schedule, whatever helps you boost your health.

569
00:54:53,415 --> 00:55:00,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think people should necessarily stop gaming, just compensate with other stuff along with it.

570
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:05,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is too much gaming?

571
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:08,810
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you define it for yourself right now?

572
00:55:09,366 --> 00:55:17,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much gaming, I don't think it's a fixed number of hours or anything like that.

573
00:55:19,673 --> 00:55:24,296
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's when you start feeling bad and you are not enjoying gaming as much.

574
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:25,817
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's too much.

575
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,199
[SPEAKER_00]: You should refresh.

576
00:55:31,308 --> 00:55:38,593
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, go outside sounds cliche, but, you know, it works unless you live in dark Sweden, you know.

577
00:55:39,113 --> 00:55:40,334
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, maybe not that part.

578
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:42,876
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah.

579
00:55:50,588 --> 00:56:03,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Apart from going on walks, having a fixed streaming schedule and taking MadMonq and Champion, what are other ways that you think about your health?

580
00:56:08,382 --> 00:56:09,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely eat any sugar.

581
00:56:11,903 --> 00:56:17,065
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I do, it's, you know, from fruit juice.

582
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

583
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:19,946
[SPEAKER_00]: But not that much anymore.

584
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:24,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to really, really limit my sugar intake.

585
00:56:24,687 --> 00:56:27,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So no chips, no candies, no sodas.

586
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,051
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get used to it, you know, and you feel better.

587
00:56:34,513 --> 00:56:35,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleep is very important too.

588
00:56:38,359 --> 00:56:38,960
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do you sleep?

589
00:56:40,222 --> 00:56:45,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Not enough, but that's because of, you know, dogs.

590
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Interviews like this.

591
00:56:48,759 --> 00:56:54,265
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get proper sleep in a capital, I think.

592
00:56:55,466 --> 00:56:58,449
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to move outside of a capital to get really good sleep.

593
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:07,938
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't sleep well, what do you observe on yourself when you don't sleep well?

594
00:57:11,311 --> 00:57:16,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, focus, my focusing times become shorter and shorter.

595
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:20,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Eyes hurt.

596
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:26,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the usual stuff, you know, concentration.

597
00:57:28,685 --> 00:57:28,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

598
00:57:29,566 --> 00:57:30,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, Sebastian.

599
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:31,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

600
00:57:31,468 --> 00:57:33,389
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pleasure talking.

601
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this again.

602
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:36,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

603
00:57:36,552 --> 00:57:36,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
